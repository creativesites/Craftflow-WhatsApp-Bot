Retinoids such as vitamin A, retinol, and retinoic acid can help strengthen your hair and  prevent hair loss and breakage. Biotin, folic acid, and pyridoxine are also good vitamins that aid in growth.\nScalp massages - Hair growth is dependent on blood circulation of the scalp. Blood vessels carry nourishment to the hair bulbs located in the scalp. Massage your scalp with oil or while washing your hair.\n\nExercise - since we’re on the topic of blood circulation, exercising is a wonderful way to increase circulation not only to your scalp, but your entire body! As you exercise, blood is circulated throughout your body and your hair receives the nutrients it needs.\n\nDiet - A cysteine and protein-rich diet can help your hair grow. Fish and lean meats such as chicken and turkey contain vitamins and minerals that are essential to hair growth. Eggs, seeds, nuts and various berries are more foods that can assist in growing your tresses long and beautiful.\n\nDrink more water - A quenched body equals quenched hair. When your hair is moisturized, it is able to thrive and grow. Think of your hair as a plant that not only needs love, but plenty of water.\n\nClean scalp - Stay clear of product build-up because it will stunt the growth of your hair. Use either shampoo or a clarifying conditioner to rid the pores on your scalp of any product build up, bacteria, dirt, and excess oil that will hinder new hair.\n\nCut back on manipulation - Use protective styles and wash-and-go’s in order to cut back on the amount of mechanical manipulation of your hair. If you continuously pull, twist, brush and comb your hair, it becomes stressed out and cannot grow.\n\nCut back on heat - Heat styling such as flat ironing and blow drying damages your hair and stunts its growth. Try to style your hair without using heat. Pin curls, bantu knots, twists, and finger coils are just a few styles to choose from.\n\nAvoid hair bands and rubber bands-Hair ties and rubber bands snag hair and rip it from your scalp. This is especially true of  those that have metal closures.\n\nTrim problems away -Getting a regular trim helps cut away old and dead ends of your hair. These ends weigh down and your hair making it difficult for new growth\n"},{"role": "user","content": "how to make twist last longer\n"},{"role": "assistant","content": " Use a foam or mousse when twisting, stay away from water, retwist with holding spray,oil or serum\n"},{"role": "user","content":"How do I get rid of frizzy hair fast?\n"},{"role": "assistant","content":" Frizzy hair is a result of the outer layer, called the cuticle being raised and giving the appearance of frazzled hair. Here are 10 ways to combat your frizzy hair:\n\nMoisture! Moisture! Moisture! - One of the causes of frizzy hair is a lack of moisture. Your scalp may not be producing enough oils or, if your hair is curly or coily, the oils produced by your scalp might not be reaching down through your hair shaft.\n\nGive Your Brush and Comb a Break - You can lift the cuticle layer through daily mechanical manipulation. Brushes and combs are your enemy when you are trying to combat frizz. Instead opt to detangle your hair with your fingers\n\nYou Are What You Eat - It is a totally overused saying, however, it does hold a lot of truth. Your hair is a reflection of the foods you put into your body. Specifically, a protein-rich diet helps with frizz by strengthening the hair shaft and the cuticles\n\nTurn Down the Heat - Heat damage from flat ironing and blow drying can make your hair frizzy. The heat is literally lifting your cuticles and making your hair more susceptible to damage. Instead, try drying hair with a diffuser, which is less harsh than a blow dryer.\n\nShampoo A Little Less - Shampooing cleanses your hair but it also strips your hair of natural oils, which leaves your hair dry. Dry hair equals frizzy hair. So skip a few lathers, and instead opt to co-wash or use a clarifying conditioner.\n\nIt’s the Way You Dry - Making sure your hair is completely dry after washing or styling helps ensure the hair cuticles lie flat. It is recommended that you dry your hair with a microfiber towel as opposed to a regular towel that roughens your cuticles. Ultimately, air drying your hair is the best option to avoid additional mechanical damage\n\nStay Away From the Alcohol - No not that kind of alcohol! Alcohol found in your hair products such as heat protectants, hair sprays, and mousses can dry your hair out leaving it dry and brittle. Avoid products that list alcohol as the first or second ingredient.\n\nDrink those 8 glasses - You know the drill! Your hair is thirsty, which means you are thirsty! Get those eight glasses of water in daily and your cuticles will be lying flat and thanking you. Remember, your hair reflects what you are putting into your body or rather what you are not.\n\nSweat It Out - For those that keep a decent workout routine, remember to wrap up your hair during your time at the gym. Also, make sure you cleanse your hair regularly to rid your scalp of all the salt left behind from your workout. Dry shampoos are a good option to clean your scalp in between your wash day. Peppermint, tea tree, natural antibacterial oils are also able to clean your hair and offer moisture.\n\nWrap It Up - Wrapping up your hair or wearing protective styles protects your hair from damage caused by the elements, and also gives your hair a break from any mechanical manipulation. Scarfs, hats, buns, or protective styles are a few ways to protect your hair.\n"},{"role": "user","content": "what can i do to dyed hair\n"},{"role": "assistant","content": " While there are many ways to maintain color treated hair, you must first start with a color safe shampoo.

Your hair, skin, and nails are the first to show signs that something is wrong (or good) internally. Make a conscious effort to drink the recommended eight glasses of water daily to help ensure that your scalp is getting the water it needs to function properly.\n\nConsuming foods such as watermelons and cucumbers that are full of water are great ways to get your daily water intake.\n\nTaking daily vitamins will also aid your scalp in producing the oils and moisture it needs. Vitamin A, fish oil, biotin, and zinc are a few vitamins that help the overall health of your scalp and body.\n\nWe all love a good massage, even your scalp! Blood circulation throughout your scalp allows it to get vital nutrients and produce the necessary oils to keep your scalp moisturized.\n\nAdd a dime size of oil (coconut or olive) to the tips of your fingers. Warm the oil between your hands and begin to massage your scalp in a circular motion. The oil will help to add moisture to your dry scalp, and the massage will increase the blood flow.\n\nWater is described as “hard” when it is contaminated with minerals and salts that can clog your scalp’s pores and suck the moisture out of your skin. It may be the last thing you think could cause damage to your hair, but water’s properties can affect your scalp’s health.\n\nConsider investing in a water purifying system or make sure to get your water tested for any unnecessary products.\n\nKeep in mind the temperature of your water.

Retinoids such as vitamin A, retinol, and retinoic acid can help strengthen your hair and  prevent hair loss and breakage. Biotin, folic acid, and pyridoxine are also good vitamins that aid in growth.\nScalp massages - Hair growth is dependent on blood circulation of the scalp. Blood vessels carry nourishment to the hair bulbs located in the scalp. Massage your scalp with oil or while washing your hair.\nExercise - ince we’re on the topic of blood circulation, exercising is a wonderful way to increase circulation not only to your scalp, but your entire body! As you exercise, blood is circulated throughout your body and your hair receives the nutrients it needs. \nDiet - A cysteine and protein-rich diet can help your hair grow. Fish and lean meats such as chicken and turkey contain vitamins and minerals that are essential to hair growth. Eggs, seeds, nuts and various berries are more foods that can assist in growing your tresses long and beautiful.\nDrink more water - A quenched body equals quenched hair. When your hair is moisturized, it is able to thrive and grow. Think of your hair as a plant that not only needs love, but plenty of water. \nClean scalp - Stay clear of product buildup because it will stunt the growth of your hair. Use either shampoo or a clarifying conditioner to rid the pores on your scalp of any product build up, bacteria, dirt, and excess oil that will hinder new hair.\nCut back on manipulation - Use protective styles and wash-and-go’s in order to cut back on the amount of mechanical manipulation of your hair. If you continuously pull, twist, brush and comb your hair, it becomes stressed out and cannot grow. \nCut back on heat - Heat styling such as flat ironing and blow drying damages your hair and stunts its growth. Try to style your hair without using heat. Pin curls, bantu knots, twists, and finger coils are just a few styles to choose from. \nAvoid hair bands and rubber bands-Hair ties and rubber bands snag hair and rip it from your scalp.This is especially true of  those that have metal closures. \nTrim problems away -Getting a regular trim helps cut away old and dead ends of your hair.

Here are 10 ways to combat your frizzy hair:\nMoisture! Moisture! Moisture! - One of the causes of frizzy hair is a lack of moisture. Your scalp may not be producing enough oils or, if your hair is curly or coily, the oils produced by your scalp might not be reaching down through your hair shaft.\nGive Your Brush and Comb a Break - You can lift the cuticle layer through daily mechanical manipulation. Brushes and combs are your enemy when you are trying to combat frizz. Instead opt to detangle your hair with your fingers\nYou Are What You Eat - It is a totally overused saying, however, it does hold a lot of truth. Your hair is a reflection of the foods you put into your body. Specifically, a protein-rich diet helps with frizz by strengthening the hair shaft and the cuticles. \nTurn Down the Heat - Heat damage from flat ironing and blow drying can make your hair frizzy. The heat is literally lifting your cuticles and making your hair more susceptible to damage. Instead, try drying hair with a diffuser, which is less harsh than a blow dryer.\nShampoo A Little Less - Shampooing cleanses your hair but it also strips your hair of natural oils, which leaves your hair dry. Dry hair equals frizzy hair. So skip a few lathers, and instead opt to co-wash or use a clarifying conditioner. \nIt’s the Way You Dry - Making sure your hair is completely dry after washing or styling helps ensure the hair cuticles lie flat. It is recommended that you dry your hair with a microfiber towel as opposed to a regular towel that roughens your cuticles. Ultimately, air drying your hair is the best option to avoid additional mechanical damage. \nStay Away From the Alcohol - No not that kind of alcohol! Alcohol found in your hair products such as heat protectants, hair sprays, and mousses can dry your hair out leaving it dry and brittle. Avoid products that list alcohol as the first or second ingredient.\n Drink those 8 glasses - You know the drill! Your hair is thirsty, which means you are thirsty! Get those eight glasses of water in daily and your cuticles will be lying flat and thanking you. Remember, your hair reflects what you are putting into your body or rather what you are not.\nSweat It Out - For those that keep a decent workout routine, remember to wrap up your hair during your time at the gym. Also, make sure you cleanse your hair regularly to rid your scalp of all the salt left behind from your workout. Dry shampoos are a good option to clean your scalp in between your wash day. Peppermint, tea tree, natural antibacterial oils are  also able to clean your hair and offer moisture.\nWrap It Up - Wrapping up your hair or wearing protective styles protects your hair from damage caused by the elements, and also gives your hair a break from any mechanical manipulation. Scarfs, hats, buns, or protective styles are a few ways to protect your hair. "},{"role": "user","content":"What are some best practices for maintaining a healthy scalp?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Avoid excessive product and sweat build up. Heavy buildup of products as a result of inefficient cleansing methods can clog the scalp pores and lead to less sebum production. \nRegularly shampooing and conditioning, removes dirt and bacteria and will not dry out the scalp and hair. \nUtilizing antibacterial oils such as tea tree and peppermint will help kill bacteria and clear dirt between washes. \nLack of water in your body can cause dry scalp. Your hair, skin, and nails are the first to show signs that something is wrong (or good) internally. Make a conscious effort to drink the recommended eight glasses of water daily to help ensure that your scalp is getting the water it needs to function properly. \nConsuming foods such as watermelons and cucumbers that are full of water are great ways to get your daily water intake. \nTaking daily vitamins will also aid your scalp in producing the oils and moisture it needs. Vitamin A, fish oil, biotin, and zinc are a few vitamins that help the overall health of your scalp and body.\nWe all love a good massage, even your scalp! Blood circulation throughout your scalp allows it to get vital nutrients and produce the necessary oils to keep your scalp moisturized. \nAdd a dime size of oil (coconut or olive) to the tips of your fingers. Warm the oil between your hands and begin to massage your scalp in a circular motion. The oil will help to add moisture to your dry scalp, and the massage will increase the blood flow. \nWater is described as “hard” when it is contaminated with minerals and salts that can clog your scalp’s pores and suck the moisture out of your skin. It may be the last thing you think could cause damage to your hair, but water’s properties can affect your scalp’s health. \nConsider investing in a water purifying system or make sure to get your water tested for any unnecessary products. \nKeep in mind the temperature of your water. Hot or warm water opens the pores of your scalp whereas cold water closes or tightens the pores. Add in your moisture agents after you wash with warm water and make sure to seal that moisture with cool water."},{"role":"user","content":"How can I maintain my twist out?"},{"role":"assistant","content":" Use a foam or mousse when twisting, stay away from water, retwist with holding spray,oil or serum\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Does brittle hair mean protein overload?"},{"role": "assistant","content":"We recommend our Hair Analysis kit which can provide you with the details surrounding your hair and also if your hair is suffering from protein loss and to also schedule a session with our hair consultants who will provide you with a clear plan to address your specific hair challenges.
